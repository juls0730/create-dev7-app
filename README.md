Loads of stuff here is outright stolen from the <a href="https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app">T3 Stack</a>, I just wanted to give massive props to the guys working on the T3 Stack, without them I wouldnt have the pages for the componenets and I probably wouldnt even have the name Dev7 without them and you'll even notice this readme is basically theirs but less cool, so go and give them a star or something!
